# Problem Statement

The Scholastic Aptitude Test(SAT) was created by the college board and it is facing an increasing competition from counterpart, the America College Testing(ACT). The ACT signed different contracts with different states to administer the Junior and Senior mandated testing for college entry. This has stationed the ACT's competitiveness even stronger compared to the SAT. With the new format for the SAT released in March 2016 that have seen noticeable chnages in both participation level and test score,there is even a deeper concern for the Board to increase it's attractiveness and relevance.

AS part of the team researching national trends in testing from 2017 to 2018 with emphasis on states participation and test scores, my presentation is centered on providing recommendations based on data available and my analysis purposely to inform the Board on the best path to thread regarding our marketing and funding strategy. How can the SAT increase participation with data available? Where can we center our marketing and funding?

# Data Analysis Report

The data bases of SAT and ACT for 2017 and 2018 was extracted.The data was cleaned of unwanted rows,column as well as ensuring no data was missing. A quantitative analysis was carried out to understand the behaviour of the data.A summary statistic was done to measure the mean, standard deviation as well as minimum and maximum analysis.Different figures was constructed to visualize the outcome of every calculation carried out.The heatmap was used to show correlations and the histogram drawn to determine frequency distribution of all the data sets.A scatter plot was also used to observe and show relationships between different numeric variables.The boxplot was also constructed to identify mean values, the dispersion of the data set, and signs of skewness.And most importantly to this research was the bar charts which helped in a wink to compare and track changes between the SAT and ACT with respect to participation rate over time.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The SAT has seen a very strong competition from its counterpart, the ACT from 2017 through 2018 that resulted in low participation rate. A thorough analysis to unravel issues that has posed danger to the participation level of the SAT college test is imperative.

The percentage of participation by individual state in ACT is higher than that of SAT in most states. The average rate of participation for SAT in 2017 and 2018 is 39 percent and 45 percent respectively. Whereas average participation rate for the ACT for 2017 and 2018 is 65 and 61 percent respectively. This shows that on avergae, the SAT gets 42 percent participation rate from potential college students compare to the ACT with an average of 63 percent.

Also, there was a total of eleven states scoring below five percent participation rate in SAT for the two years investigated.Whereas during same period for ACT, no state scored less that five percent. The lowest was seven percent.According to Census Bureau, the state of Mississippi, compared to other states and national median, have the lowest scores in terms of household income between 2017 and 2018.Results from this research also reval Mississippi having the lowest participation rate for the same period.

According to Chatmeter,"Want to stand out from your competitor? Do better than them". The SAT Board should study the initiatives enshrined in the contracts ACT implemented with different states that yielded such a huge success to be competitive.The SAT Board should run an initiate that will states with low household income benefit to increase participation rate and cover inequality gap. For instance, states like Iowa,Mississippi and North Dakota, which repeatedly appear under four percent participation rate for the two years investigated, should be key areas to channel any marketing strategy.
